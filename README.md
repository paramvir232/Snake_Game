# Snake Game in Python using Turtle Graphics

![Snake Game Demo](demo.gif)

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics module. The game features include restart functionality, dynamic speed adjustment, score tracking, smooth snake movement, and randomized food generation.

## Features

- **Restart Functionality:** Restart the game instantly after a game over.
- **Dynamic Speed:** The snake's speed increases as it eats more food, making the game progressively challenging.
- **Score Counter:** Keep track of your score as you collect food.
- **Smooth Snake Movements:** Responsive controls allow the snake to move smoothly across the screen.
- **Randomized Food Generation:** Food spawns randomly on the screen, adding an element of unpredictability.
